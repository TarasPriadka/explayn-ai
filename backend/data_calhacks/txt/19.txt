Berkeley SkyDeck
Berkeley SkyDeck UC Berkeleyâ€™s global hub for entrepreneurship. We support startups founded by UC Berkeley students, alumni, and faculty who are seeking to bring their scientific and technical discoveries to market, and commercialize groundbreaking UC Berkeley research. SkyDeck also welcomes startups founded by affiliates of any of the ten University of California campuses, and startups who are located outside the US seeking to connect with students and faculty at UC Berkeley.
 
Many SkyDeck programs support education for UC Berkeley students through internships, professional development, and opportunities for students to learn about startup creation and launch. Every semester we host one of the biggest virtual intern fairs in the Silicon Valley. Our upcoming intern fair is on December 9th! If you are a UCB student looking for a Spring internship at one of SkyDeck's innovative startups, complete the interest form here and we will be in touch with you directly: https://forms.gle/RZp4PdH6ihvc3edU6
