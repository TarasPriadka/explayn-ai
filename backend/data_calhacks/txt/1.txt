Otto
Otto is a VC-backed startup building the future of pet care. We're bringing together 24/7 vet care and curated products & services – creating the personalized "stack" for pet parenting. With our animal shelter partnerships, we're the friend that tens of thousands use to navigate their first weeks after adoption.
We’ve raised over $1.6 million in funding from top investors, including Arielle Zuckerberg (Long Journey Ventures), Jonathan Swanson (Thumbtack), Amjad Masad (Replit), Josh Browder (DoNotPay), Michael Stoppelman (Yelp), and many more.
Everyone on the Otto team is younger than 20 – we’re strong believers in a tight-knit, scrappy culture. Right now, we're hiring across the board for full-time and part-time software engineer positions. To learn more, visit otto.pet/careers.
