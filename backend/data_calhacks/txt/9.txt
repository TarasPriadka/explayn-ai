Solana Foundation Sponsorship
The Solana Foundation is excited to announce we are sponsoring Cal Hacks. We are even more excited to have some of the Solana Foundation team attending IRL! We can’t wait to see who wins the $2,500 in prizes for building on Solana. As one of the world’s largest collegiate hackathons Cal Hacks is an awesome opportunity to come together and learn about blockchain and experiment by building projects that could have a real impact on the growth of the Solana ecosystem. 
We look forward to seeing you at Cal Hacks and working with you IRL to deliver live workshops and developer support as we continue to build the decentralized future on Solana!
Solana is a decentralized blockchain built to enable scalable, user-friendly apps for the world.
“Powerful for developers. Fast for everyone”

Low cost forever - Less than $0.01 for both developers and users
Secure & Decentralized - Censorship resistant network with thousands of nodes
Scalability - As hardware gets faster, so does the network. Never worry about scaling again.
