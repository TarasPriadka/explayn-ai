Digital Ocean
Weâ€™re thrilled to partner with Cal Hacks 9.0 this year! At DigitalOcean, we believe 'our community is bigger than just us,' and Cal Hacks is a perfect example of that belief in action. We know developers, and they love to solve problems that challenge them and stretch their capabilities, and this event promises to do just that. A hackathon for the global community of students and developers is immensely exciting, but combining it with a focus on social good is something we know our community will love. We are coming out with a special offer of a $200 DigitalOcean Cloud credit for all Cal Hacks participants that hackers can use to deploy and showcase their projects. In addition to the cloud credit, we will be providing the first 200 hackers who sign up using that link with an opportunity to claim a special swag kit that could include a t-shirt, sticker pack, or Sammy Shark stress ball! Signup for DO Cloud credit and submit this form for your chance to win the swag kit!
