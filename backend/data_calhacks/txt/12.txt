Everlaw
Everlaw is a collaborative, cloud-based litigation platform for corporate counsels, litigators and government attorneys that enables teams to discover, illuminate, and act on information to better drive internal investigations and positively impact the outcome of litigation.
 
Unlike slow, unwieldy, client-server software and expensive third-party service providers, only Everlaw combines speed, security, and ease-of-use into a unified, comprehensive solution that unlocks the collaborative power of teams and enables them to investigate issues more thoroughly, uncover truth more quickly, and present their findings more clearly.
 
At Everlaw, our mission is to promote justice by illuminating truth. Our company culture is open and vibrant and weâ€™re committed to the professional growth of our team members, offering an annual learning and development stipend and regular check-ins with managers regarding career goals.
