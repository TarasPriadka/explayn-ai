Scroll
Scroll is building a bytecode-level equivalent zkEVM zk-Rollup to scale Ethereum. Existing Ethereum applications can migrate onto Scroll as is. Scroll is open-sourced from day one, collaborating closely with the Ethereum Foundation, and dedicated to scaling Ethereum for the next billion users.
If our vision of scaling Ethereum in an open and community-driven way resonates with you, we are looking for values-aligned and self-motivated individuals to help Scroll become the most developer- and user-friendly scaling solution for Ethereum.
