default-deny, or whitelist, policy is one wherein by default, every network service is denied to external users, unless it has been specifically listed as allowed 35   fails-open A default-allow policy fails-open meaning that if any mistake is made, the result is likely to be some form of an expensive security failure 35   fails-closed A default-deny policy fails closed meaning that if any mistake is made, then the result is the loss of functionality or availability, but not a security breach 35   stateful packet filter A stateful packet filter is a router than checks each packet against the provided access control policy 35   stateless packet filters Stateless packet filters tend to operate on the network level and generally only look at TCP, UDP, and IP headers 35   path traversal attack A path traversal attack is an attack wherein unauthorized files are accessed on a remote server by exploiting Unix file path semantics 36   nids NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection Systems) is a detector installed on the network, between the local network and the rest of the Internet 36   evasion attack An evasion attack exploits inconsistencies and ambiguities to provide malicious inputs that are not detected by the NIDS 36   hids HIDS (Host Based Intrusion Detection System) is a detector installed on each end system 36   logging logging is a process wherein you analyze log files generated by end systems 36   false positive A false positive is when the detector alerts when there is no attack 36   false negative A false negative is when the detector fails to alert when there is an attack 36   false positive rate False positive rate (FPR) is the probability the detector alerts, given there is no attack 36   false negative rate False negative rate (FNR) is the probability the detector does not alert, given there is an attack 36   signature-based detection ‘Signature-based detection flags any activity that matches the structure of a known attack" 36   blacklisting Signature based detection is blacklisting wherein you keep a list of patterns that are not allowed, and alert if we see something on the list 36   specification-based detection Specification based detection specifies allowed behavior and flags any behavior that isn’t allowed behavior 36   whitelisting Specification-based detection is whitelisting, which keeps a list of allowed patterns, and alerts if we see something that is not on the list 36   anomaly-based detection Anomaly based detection develops a model of what normal activity looks like and alerts on any activity that deviates from normal activity 36   vulnerability scanning Vulnerability scanning uses a tool that proves your own system with a wide range of attacks (and fixes any successful attacks) 36   honeypot Honeypot is a sacrificial system with no real purpose 36   forensics Forensics is analyzing what happens after a successful attack 36   ips Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is an intrusion detection system that also blocks attacks 36   malware Malware (also known as malcode or malicious software) is an attacker code running on victim computers 38   self-replicating code Self-replicating code is a code snippet that outputs a copy of itself 38   virus A virus is code that requires user action to propagate 38   worm A worm is code that does not require user action to propagate 38   polymorphic code Polymorphic code is code such that each time the virus propagates, it inserts an encrypted copy of the code 38   metamorphic code Metamorphic code is code such that each time the virus propagates, it generates a semantically different version of the code 38   morris worm The Morris Worm is considered the first internet worm and exploits multiple buffer overflows to guess common passwords to exploit common user accounts across different machines 38   rootkit A rootkit is malcode in the operating system that hides its presence 38   proxy A proxy is a third party that relays our Internet traffic 39   collusion Collusion is when multiple proxies work together and share information 39   tor Tor is a network that uses onion routing to enable anonymous communications 39   tor hidden services Tor hidden services are websites that are only accessible through the Tor network 39   dark markets Dark markets are marketplaces for buying and selling illegal goods 39   cybercrime forums Cybercrime forums are websites for discussing illegal activity 39
